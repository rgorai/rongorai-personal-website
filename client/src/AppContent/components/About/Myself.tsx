      My name is Rajarshi, but I go by Ron. I have been interested in
      STEM throughout my life, ever since my grandfather showed me
      around the engineering labs at the world famous Indian Institute
      of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur during my early childhood. For
      years after that, I had been participating in numerous
      STEM-related programs like engineering summer camps and robotics
      teams.

      Once I started high school, I got my first real taste of
      programming doing robotics for an FTC robotics team. I was
      really intrigued by the way software worked and how many
      different things can be done with it. So, I signed up for every
      programming class my school offered, from web development to AP
      computer Science.

      Until this point, I had always planned to go into an engineering
      field due to my early interest in machines and science. However,
      I quickly realized the power of software and the crucial role it
      holds in modern society. Since I had already had years of
      education and an internship project in computer science, I
      decided to pursue a software-related program in college.

      While looking through college programs, I was fascinated to find
      that a couple of the schools I was applying had a new,
      specialized degree: cybersecurity. Even though I had not had any
      real experience with software security, I felt that it would
      best to pursue this field because of the ever-growing need for
      security professionals in todayâ€™s software-driven world.

      I am currently a 4/5 at the Stevens Institute of Technology in
      Hoboken, NJ pursuing a BS in Cybersecurity.
