  My name is Rajarshi, but I go by Ron. I have been interested in STEM
  throughout my life, ever since my grandfather showed me around the
  engineering labs at the world famous Indian Institute of Technology
  (IIT) in Kharagpur during my early childhood. For years after that,
  I had been participating in numerous STEM-related programs like
  engineering summer camps and robotics teams.
